<h2>Hey there, I'm Shree Charan :wave:</h2>

<h4>About me :vulcan_salute:</h4>

- I'm a second year Information Science undergrad with a passion for full stack development.  
- I am an experienced developer skilled in Full Stack Development, MERN, and Firebase.  
- I'm curently working on a mobile app with flutter (private repo).  
- You can reach me at the email in my bio.

I've worked with my college in developing a progressive web application which provides a programming interface for students to get their programming assignmentd done.
(It's a private repo:confused:). You can check it out at https://vlabs.bmsedu.in/support.   
I'm currently working on a flutter application (again a private repo).

Feel free to reach out for any help or collabs :love_you_gesture:
